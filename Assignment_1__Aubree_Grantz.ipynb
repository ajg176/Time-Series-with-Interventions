Hence, KC Furniture has secured a bank loan of up to \\$6000 to pay for February's raw material cost. The bank has agreed to a second loan to also pay for February's labor cost, provided that the total labor cost is at least \\$2000 lower than the total raw material cost in the month. How many couches and cabinets (can be fractional) should KC Furniture produce in February to maximize total profit?"
